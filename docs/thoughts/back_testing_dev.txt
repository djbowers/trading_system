Notes about back testing:

- start with BTC-USD and expand.
- get all history of coin in table 
- use  play period by period (1 minute) and simulate what would have happened
if this strategy was employed. Results should be graphically shown on chart as layer on top of asset candles. 

-show results as chart with colors indicating P & L 

-Try to see if common events occur to filter some triggers


------------------------------
Back Testing Dev Steps:

	1. conncet to Gdax API
	2. connect to SQL DB
3. update SQL DB with BTC-USD price history candles (ganularity = 1 minute candles)
4. structure tables
5. create algorithm func to run testing on
6. create reporting system to show results/effectiveness of stratedgy
7. test running code on aws EC2
8. setup trial run for 1 week to ensure no major errors occur
9. launch
