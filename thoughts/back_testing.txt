Notes about back testing:

- start with BTC-USD and expand.
- get all history of coin in table 
- use  play period by period (1 minute) and simulate what would have happened
if this strategy was employed. Results should be graphically shown on chart as layer on top of asset candles. 

-show results as chart with colors indicating P & L 

-Try to see if common events occur to filter some triggers
