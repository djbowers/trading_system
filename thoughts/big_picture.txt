This is an overview of the Trading Bot and its functions:

*Note: The algorithm used to identify market positions must be back-tested to ensure success. See back_testing.txt

There are many pieces to this bot but the end result is simple:
	1. A system that uses price history data of an asset to identify entry points for market postitions.  
	2. Once a position is established a stop is placed. 
	3. Positions can be both long (buy) and short (sell). 
	4. Active positions are managed by the minute to identify closed positions or to adjust stops as market goes in a favorable direction. 
	5. Report all activity for review. 
	6. Have an interface to see where all positions are for us mortals. 
 
1. Establish Position
	a. Identify Entry Points
		Use an algorithm to watch for entry triggers:
			primary: If price goes above (or below) 24 hour high (or low), buy (or short) asset 1 unit.
			pyramid: If price is XN (X = multiple up to 5, N = 1 ATR) above (or below), an additional unit is purchased.
	b. Position Size
		unit = 2% of total equity (including active positions)
		contract_risk = $(2N stop)
		position_size = round_down(unit/contract_risk)
		number_of_units_to_buy = position_size

		*Note: If total equity down more than 10%, reduce unit size by 20%
	c. Log Activity
		Enter Trade Data: 
			- Trade ID
			- Long or Short
			- Date Entered
			- Asset Price (in USD)
			- Position Value (in USD)
			- Position Value %
			- Contract Risk (2N Stop $)

2. Exit Signals
	Primary: If price goes below (or above) 12 hour low (or high)
	secondary: 2N stop
	pyramid: As price goes in favorable direction, all stops are moved to top position (current 12 hour low (or high) or 2N stop)
	
	Log Activity:
		- Current Stop $ amt
		- Date Stop added

	*Note: All open positions MUST have an active stop

3. Long or Short
	The triggers are effective both up or down in price.

4. Manage Open Positions
	Every minute a program is ran to watch for price to move in favorable direction. If it does, all active stops are moved in that direction by N.
	Ensure every active position has a stop.
	
	Log Activity:
		- Current Stop $ amt
		- Date Stop added

MSC NOTES:
	Filters:
		- Maybe: If last trade was profitable, skip attempt (add buy trigger with larger window (1 week high) to catch larger trends)
	Algorithm:
		- Maybe: look to see if Moving averages usage can show effective trend
			swings.
